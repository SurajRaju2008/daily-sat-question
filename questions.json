      "text": "A bead produced by a machine will be selected at random. If 29 out of every 100 beads have a defect, what is the probability of selecting a bead that has a defect?",
      "options": ["1/2900", "1/29", "29/100", "29/10"],
      "correctAnswer": "29/100",

      "text": "Each side of a square has a length of 45. What is the perimeter of the square?",
      "options": ["9", "96", "180", "972"],
      "correctAnswer": "180",
      "explanation": "The perimeter of a square is 4 times the length of one side. So, 4 * 45 = 180."

      "options": ["9", "96", "120", "972"],
      "correctAnswer": "9",
      "explanation": "Time is calculated by dividing the distance by the speed. Thus, 108 / 12 = 9 seconds."

      "text": "Data set X: 5, 9, 9, 13; Data set Y: 5, 9, 9, 13, 27. Which statement correctly compares the mean of data set X and data set Y?",
      "options": [
        "The mean of data set X is greater than the mean of data set Y.",

        "The means of data set X and data set Y are equal.",
        "There is not enough information to compare the means."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "The mean of data set X is less than the mean of data set Y.",
      "explanation": "The mean of a data set is the sum of its elements divided by the number of elements. Adding 27 to data set Y increases its mean."

      "options": ["40", "48", "56", "60"],
      "correctAnswer": "48",
      "explanation": "Solving 4 + x^2 = 12 gives x^2 = 8, so x = \u00b12. Plugging x = 2 into 16x + 8 gives 16 * 2 + 8 = 48."

      "answerFormat": "numeric",
      "correctAnswer": "55",
      "explanation": "The maximum number of candles is calculated by dividing the budget by the price per candle: 2200 / 11.60 \u2248 189.66. However, since 200 candles are required, the budget is insufficient. Thus, only 55 can be bought."
